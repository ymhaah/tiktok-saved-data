Here are some tips to enhance your font pairings and hierarchy: - Don’t just browse your font list. Check out http://fontshare.com for great free fonts. - Use Typewolf to find visual pairings from real-world examples. - Don’t rely solely on font size to create hierarchy. Adjust font weight on paragraphs, increase leading, and ensure good contrast on smaller fonts. - Limit centered text to two lines. Always left-align your text for readability. Avoid right alignment. - Headers don’t need to be heavy to stand out.

        "title": "Mastering spacing is the secret that elevates a product designer from good to great. It's a crucial UI design skill that elevates the user experience. Why? Because our ultimate goal is to help users to navigate their desired goals effortlessly--why IA is so important. Here's a peek into my playbook: I leverage spacing (think padding & margins) to boost readability and scanability. It's all about creating harmony—tighter margins for related elements to signal connection, and generous padding (around 20 to 30 pixels) to delineate distinct sections. Horizontal spacing should be more than vertical to help create natural blocks within sections. Remember these are starting points and the true art lies in knowing when to stick to these guidelines and when it's okay to break it for the sake of a better more functional ui design. #uiux #productdesign #uidesigner #uxdesigner #appdesign  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

        "title": "If you’re trying to better understand UI/UX Design, there’s no better place to start than reading The Design of Everyday Things by Don Norman. There’s a lot to this book, but the biggest things I took away from it was the importance of Affordances and Feedback. At the end of the day, most of your job as a designer is to create interaction points, rank them by importance to the user persona, and then get the ideal user persona to click on those buttons. So the best way to get users to click on buttons in your UX Design is add affordances. Affordances are signifiers that guide users on what interaction points will do. It’s easy to forget how important this is because designers are often biased towards the context that users will have. When you’ve been working on the same product for months, things that are natural to you are complete unknowns to the users. While some users will be okay clicking around until they figure it out, it’s best to streamline the user flow by showing tooltips, subheadings, and learn more buttons. This will make it so power users can ignore them while newcomers will gain confidence. Now, once a user taps the buttons or fills out a form, they need to know that it worked. If you don’t offer that to users, it makes even power users feel nervous that the desired action didn’t happen. This can make our users feel like they don’t know how to use the product and rather than learn how to use it, they’ll just stop using it. That’s why we need to add as much feedback as we can to let users know that things have happened or when things are moving slow, that there is still progress being made. If you’re interested in UX Design you really need to check out this book! #uxdesign #uiux #uxdesigner #appdesign #webdesign #productdesigner  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

You’ll take your brand color, and add an overlay on top of it. You’ll set the overlay to white and black and then have different opacities on it to create a palette. This is my go to process for product design because in app design, you really don’t want to overdo it with color. Most of your app should be black and white with splashes of color and secondary highlights to distinguish different sections in the layout. This means that to use color to bring out a better information architecture, you only need a black color, a white color, a border color, and a secondary highlight. Making your blacks and whites tinted to the brand color will take your designs to the next level! #appdesign #uiux #colordesign  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

        "title": "You want to show brand logos on your landing page. This is the easiest and most attractive way to do that. First, stop going to Google images and searching by brand. Instead, use an app called BrandFetch. Pull directly from their website or use their Figma plugin. Next, open the PNG or SVG versions of your logos in Photoshop. Open up Layer Styles, and set a Color Overlay to white or black. This most certainly goes against the brand usage guidelines of many brands, but I’m not a lawyer, just a janky ass designer. Choose a maximum width to be used for your logos. I like to choose a max width AND height for the container of the logo, and then resize the logo within. One thing I’ll add is when choosing these dimensions, I multiply them by 2 or 3.  So if my max-width of the logo on the web page needs to be 200pixels, I’ll save the image with a max-width of 4 or 600 pixels. This allows me to a crispier resolution of the image on retina displays without sacrificing too much page load performance. And as a side note, you don’t have to name your image files with 2x or 3x anymore, you simply have to make sure the HTML img tag uses a srcset parameter with the correct value, like 2x or 3x. Put the logos on a contrasting background, set opacity to 80% and boom. You have yourself a good looking AND performant brand logo section on your landing page. If you want to add an extra detail, set a mouse hover effect on the logo images to transform the scale of the logo by 1.2 and opacity to 100%.

        "title": "Here's how to make the ui design for bento box grids! Bento box grids are super trendy right now. In both product design and web design, the Bento grid is doing wonders organizing lots of relevant information. The big challenge with bento grids is going overboard with the content. If you don't strategically prioritize certain boxes in the grid, the ui design may look nice, but the ux design and readability can fall apart. The best way to be strategic here is to lower the amount of information per box. Aim for 1 header and 2 small lines of text at most. Add a graphic, but especially in the smaller boxes, have the graphic be simple and express ONE idea visually. The next step is to try to guide the user's eyes with text by putting the text in a z reading pattern. #uiux #uidesign #webdesign #bentobox  created by RadWebDesigns with RadWebDesigns’s original sound",

        "title": "In UI design, it’s often little details that make all the difference. A good shadow can make or break a design. The biggest thing that I focus on when adding shadows to my designs is that you need to make users feel the shadow, but not think about the shadow. The best way to do that is make them really soft. Shadows in UI need to follow lighting rules as they happen in the real world. An element that sits above another should cast shadow on the elements behind. And in my opinion, shadows should only be on the most important elements which are really “in your face” meaning those elements are much closer to you in 3d space. With that, I can make really soft bubbly UI by adding a shadow that is between 10 and 20 pixels Y, 20 to 40 pixels of blur, and a really light opacity between 8% and 12%. Those guidelines of shadow will get you through a lot of shadow blocks! #uidesign #uidesigner #uiux #designtutorials  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

        "title": "Design is not art--design is action. That's why UX design is all about harnessing user desires and moving users down the user flow. The way you direct users is through making better interaction points. Buttons should have some padding to give them attention. That padding should be wider than it is tall so that users who are scanning can easily find the interaction points. You can also make your ui design easier to scan by giving the buttons distinct colors that stand out. You can train users to look for a specific color on the page to increase the speed to finding the interaction points. Just, don't over-use primary color buttons. It should be one primary action per section or page and the other buttons should either have a border and be a ghost button or have a passive color that doesn't stand out so much. This is such a focused topic in ui design, but it's one of the most important parts of design because this is how the user navigates through the app. Being intentional with your interaction point design is a huge part! #uidesign #appdesign #uiux #uxdesign  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

Create natural groupings by adding less margins between grouped elements. Create sections by creating airy padding of around 20 to 30 pixels between them. And horizontal spacing should usually be more than vertical because it creates natural blocks within sections and groups. These are general guidelines that I use, but depending on the instance you can break these rules as needed. #uiux #uidesigner #productdesigner #uxdesigner #appdesign  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

        "title": "Replying to @soul_william Here’s how I approach my font sizes when working with Typography in my ui/ux designs. You have to use font sizes to your advantage to guide the user’s eye towards key areas. You do this by using information architecture! Information Architecture is much more than just font sizing, but typography plays a huge part in IA design. Information Architecture has us letting the user scan to confirm they’re on the right page, then scan to find the right section of content they’re looking for, then scan to find the right piece of content inside that section. This zoom-tier is how I approach all of my designs from the type I use to the colors and shadow I add. With this, we want to make page headers the largest, then section headers a little smaller, then group headers smaller than that. Some people use the fibonacci sequence or the golden ratio to map their header sizes accordingly. I’m not that particular, though it ends up similar at about 1.5x the size of the next tier. I usually start from section headers as those are the most common for scanning. Once I have that set, I work in increments of 2 or 4 points at a time until I end up with roughly 34+ points or higher in page headers, 16-26 points on sections, and 14-18pt on group headers. From there, I generally keep paragraphs around the same size as group headers or 2 to 4 points smaller and then use a thinner/lighter font weight to keep things easy to read. #informationarchitecture #iadesign #fontsize #typography #uxdesign #uiux  created by Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan with Nolan Perkins ▒ RadNolan’s original sound",

I think you shouldn't focus on UX Design too early--you can learn that as you build your UI Design skills. You should, instead, start by learning the basics of a design tool like Figma, then diving into design fundamentals by recreating a new design every day. On the side, you should stdy typography and information architecture, but don’t try to learn all of UI design at once. Take the studies slowly or you'll lose interest taking on too many things. And you'll need the time because on top of the daily UI recreation, you should also design at least 10 full app designs from start to finish. The work will be really rough for a while, and that's okay.

        "title": "So you're kicking off a web design project But before you can do any ui ux design You need to hop on a call and ask your client these questions First, what is the primary goal of the website? Are they looking for meetings booked? Demos requested? Email captures? Each requires different messaging Also, make sure to ask how people will find the website Will they be coming from ads or networking events? Will they know about the product or services at all? And to that extent, you need to understand what the visitor might be searching for before they're ready to close. With that, you'll be ready for design Before you start designing, you need to know all the context of the project. The best way to align on context is to understand what success looks like to your web design client. The way to nail that down is by asking 3 detailed questions: “What is a close?” Looking for downloads versus form signups or email captures over webinar wait listers all require different messaging. The messaging will affect the story you’re trying to tell through your web design. “What context will visitors have?” If someone meets your client in real life at a networking event, they’ll be coming to the website with very different context than someone coming from an ad. This will affect the information architecture you need to approach your design with. Finally, “What information will they need before they’re ready to close?” Needing pricing info is great, but how about competitor comparisons? Maybe details on the services is not as important as understanding the culture that the company has. These things will really set you up for success for your web design clients because it will lead to more conversions! #webdesign #webdesigner #designclients created by RadWebDesigns with RadWebDesigns’s original sound",
